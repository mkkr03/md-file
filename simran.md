##Progressive enhancement
One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:
>“Pages that are empty without JS: dead to history, unreliable for search results, and thus ignorable. No need to waste time reading or responding.


On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

>I’m exasperated by this push to require JS / get rid of CSS…but I’m angry at the conferences promoting these ideas:

####My Opinion
 I think that Java-Script will make its way to the future as it is being used and being developed. There are many popular websites on the internet which uses java-script.
